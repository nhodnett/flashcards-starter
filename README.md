## Future Additions
- The ability to review incorrect answers. Player can guess again on the answers they got wrong
- A timer to record how long it took you to complete the game

## Wins
- Learned about TDD, and utilized Mocha and Chai
- Completed game functionality before the deadline

## Challenges
- I barely completed iteration 3, and not confident on its functionality
- Iteration 2 onwards was challenging. Without help from my cohort, this project would of likely ended there
- I didn't have the spare time/confidence to try using a project board for workflow

## Summary
This was a good first project for Mod 2, to get us back in to the swing of things in terms of hands on keyboards, thinking about class to class interactions and of course introducing us to the importance of TDD. I feel my current level of knowledge was tested to the max!
